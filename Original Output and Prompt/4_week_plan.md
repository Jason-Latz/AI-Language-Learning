# 4-Week Conversational Spanish Plan

This plan mixes new material with continuous review, following spaced repetition and interleaving principles to maximize retention.  
Each week combines **Learner-Led** sessions (free conversation about your life) and **Tutor-Led** sessions (focused grammar or vocabulary).  
New vocabulary/structures are introduced on Tutor-Led days, then reinforced in subsequent sessions.

## Week 1 – Foundations & Personal Topics
**Day 1 (Learner-led, 10 min):** Daily routine (present tense, reflexive verbs).  
**Day 2 (Tutor-led, 15 min):** Last weekend (preterite vs imperfect).  
**Day 3 (Learner-led, 10 min):** Travel memory or past story.  
**Day 4 (Tutor-led, 15 min):** Plans for next weekend (ir + a + infinitive, simple future).  
**Day 5 (Learner-led, 5 min):** Free talk / consolidation (mix past and future).

## Week 2 – Daily Life & Expanding Structures
**Day 6 (Tutor-led, 10 min):** Giving advice & commands (deberías, imperative).  
**Day 7 (Learner-led, 10 min):** Healthy habits talk (use Day 6 structures).

**Day 11 (Tutor-led, 15 min):** Opinions & subjunctive (debate on technology).  
**Day 12 (Learner-led, 10 min):** Opinions on a chosen topic (apply Day 11 subjunctive).  
**Day 13 (Tutor-led, 20 min):** Hypotheticals (past subjunctive + conditional).

**Day 17 (Learner-led, 10 min):** Free chat using at least 2 idioms naturally.  
**Day 18 (Tutor-led, 10 min):** Custom review of your personal weak points.

## Session Length Templates
**5 min:** 1 warm-up → 3 min conversation/drill → 1 recap.  
**10 min:** 2 warm-up → 6 min conversation/drill → 1 shadowing → 1 recap.  
**15 min:** 3 warm-up → 9 min conversation/drills → 2 shadowing → 1 recap.  
**20 min:** 4 warm-up → 12 min conversation/drills → 2 shadowing/role-play → 2 recap.

## Quality Notes
- Protect the recap in every session (it seeds spaced review for tomorrow).  
- In Learner-Led sessions: no new topics unless you request.  
- In Tutor-Led sessions: expect 2–3 short micro-drills tied to the theme.  
- Use shadowing in sessions ≥10 minutes for pronunciation and rhythm practice.  
- Maintain ~70–80% success rate: challenging but not overwhelming.
