## Features

| Feature | What it helps with |
|--------|-------------------|
| **4‑Week Conversational Plan** | Structured mix of learner-led and tutor-led sessions to reinforce knowledge through spaced repetition and interleaving. |
| **Prompt Library & Power User Guide** | Run voice tutoring sessions with micro‑commands, adapt difficulty, and explore prompts for varied scenarios. |
| **Immediate Correction Workflow** | Errors are captured in real time and recapped for spaced review, locking in new vocabulary. |
| **Shadowing Segments & Micro‑Drills** | Practice pronunciation and listening with short drills; session logs track minutes practiced, new items learned, and corrections. |

> **Tip:** Combine features for compound practice—for example, run a shadowing segment during a learner-led session to strengthen pronunciation while recalling new vocab.

The project focuses on incremental progress. Each week builds on the previous one, and the session logs help maintain accountability by tracking minutes practiced, new items learned, and corrections made.

## Deep Research Chat

I used a Deep Research conversation to craft the original system prompt.
